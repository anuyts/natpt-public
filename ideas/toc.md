* Intro
  - Challenge (WriterT stuff)
  - overview
  
* Things that don't work
  - C^op x C
  - mixed-variant id
  - your discussion with Thorsten in Vienna
  - Jesper says you should explain this afterwards
  
* Recaps
  - presheaves
  - CwFs
  - presheaf models of TT
  - lifting functors
  - MTT
  - pro-arrow equipments

* Base categories
  - Degrees of relatedness
  - Tamsamani & Simpson's model
  - Pro-arrows
  - Extended Tamsamani & Simpson's model / jet sets
  - Modes are (in)finite lists of * and /\

* Modalities
  - variance
  - naturality
  - structurality
  - polarized reshuffling modalities

* Natural universe

* Variance of inductive types via Church encoding

* Intervals
  - path
  - bridge
  - twisted prism functor
    - Hom type is `< natural | (i : 2) -> A {i = 0 ? a0 | i = 1 ? a1} >`

* Internalization
  - Transpension and its commutation with modalities
  - Glue, Weld, Gel, extent, ...

* Fibrancy and contextual fibrancy
  - Covariance
  - Kan
  - Segal
  - Rezk
  - Conduch√©
  - Embargoes
  
* Univalence
  - Symmetric univalence
  - Directed univalence
    - Probably a section w.r.t. the forall-type of the twisted interval, but that's fine due to natural modality
  - Categorical univalence (Rezk)
  - Relational univalence
